# Next steps (working notes)

Updated as work happens, so it can be picked up after a pause. The public roadmap is
[`content/docs/roadmap.md`](content/docs/roadmap.md).

## Current state

- `main` is green: 18 end-to-end suites pass (`npm run test:all` with the service on :3000; see README "Tests").
- Done in this round: signing-key rotation, `MASTER_KEY` rotation, audit logs, email codes and magic links,
  breached-password check, custom email templates, more social providers.

## Just finished: more social providers (roadmap #7)

Microsoft, Apple, Discord, GitLab (incl. self-hosted) and generic OpenID Connect, tested by
`scripts/providers-e2e.ts` (33 checks, mock IdP on :3999 signing real ID tokens). Key points for later work:

- `src/lib/net-guard.ts` is the shared SSRF guard (`checkPublicUrl`, `guardedFetch`); use it for any URL a
  developer supplies (SAML metadata URLs next).
- `src/lib/auth/oauth-providers.ts` holds the provider registry; adding a provider = one entry in `DEFS`,
  `LABELS`, the enum (migration) and `parseSettings`.
- Microsoft emails are trusted only for personal accounts or `xms_edov: true` (nOAuth). Apple uses form POST +
  `SameSite=None` state cookie on HTTPS and a per-request ES256 client secret.
- Provider JWKS cached 10 min; refetched on unknown key / bad signature, at most every 30 s.

## Next: embeddable React components (roadmap #8)

Plan: `<SignIn />`, `<SignUp />`, `<UserButton />`, `<OrganizationSwitcher />` in `@daywalker/auth/react`,
built on the existing client methods (password, email code, passkeys, OAuth buttons from
`getEnvironment().oauthProviderLabels`, 2FA step). Unstyled-by-default with a small optional stylesheet and
`appearance` overrides; no `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`; work under a strict CSP (no inline styles needed).
Test with a Playwright page in `examples/nextjs`.

## After that (in order)

9. Enterprise SSO (SAML).
10. SMS codes (needs a provider decision from Shelby, e.g. Twilio or Vonage).

## Open items for Shelby (not blocking)

- Docker image untested; DigitalOcean binding names in `.do/app.yaml` (`${db.CA_CERT}`, `${cache.DATABASE_URL}`)
  unverified.
- Decide `PASSKEY_RP_ID` before launch (`daywalker.dev` suggested).
- CI workflow hasn't run on GitHub yet.
- Commits show "Unverified" on GitHub because they aren't signed; set up SSH/GPG signing to get "Verified".
- Old SHAs from the earlier history rewrite may linger on GitHub (only GitHub support can purge them).

## How to resume locally

```bash
npm ci && npm run db:migrate && npm run build
# service: WEBHOOK_ALLOW_PRIVATE=1 ALLOW_INSECURE_TRANSPORT=1 OAUTH_TEST_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3999 \
#   PWNED_PASSWORDS_TEST_URL=http://localhost:3997 node .next/standalone/server.js  (or next start)
npm run test:all
```
